			<p>Born in Mamaroneck, NY, Dylan Negri has a BFA in Interdisciplinary Sculpture from the Maryland Institute College of Art and also has a Concentration in ceramics. As a child, Dylan was drawn to many forms of expression. He played ice hockey for 12 years traveling around the country practicing at summer camps and playing in tournaments. However, it wasn't before long that he found his Niche in the Arts. Starting Glass blowing and Ceramics at the age of 13, he relized that being a creator was his true passion.</p>
			<p> After finishing his degree, he stayed another year working in Baltimore but then decided to move to Brooklyn, NY in 2014. It was there he worked as a contractor at a wood/metal shop learning many technical skills installing high end commercial and residential jobs throughout NYC. During this time, he continued his sculptural practice showing work in some high profile exhibisions and a museums.
				Dylan is now enrolled at the Parsons School of Design at the New School working for his MFA in Design and Technology.</p>
