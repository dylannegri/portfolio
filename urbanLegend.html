<div id="galleryTitle">"Urban Legend" is a video game I have created to illustrate the importance of
    tradition craft and providing a niche for its place in the world of new media.
    My project pulls inspiration from the issue that the arts, traditional craft and music have too
    often been the first departments to take cuts in funding for schools to save on their
    spending budget. I think that itâ€™s important to demonstrate that by teaching kid to use
    traditional craft to make new and interesting things will both allow them to express
    themselves while presenting them with lucrative career path options.
    <br>
    Much of the project was created with Playdoh and then animated with stop motion techniques.
    However, I also created assets using adobe illustrator and photoshop. I some instances I had walked
    around the city and took photos and incorporated them into the game as well.
